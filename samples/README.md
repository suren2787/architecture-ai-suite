# Sample Audit Report

This folder contains example outputs from the Architecture AI Suite to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Files

### `sample_design.md`
A realistic e-commerce platform solution design for the Hong Kong market. This represents a typical design document that would be submitted for architecture review.

**Key Features:**
- Microservices architecture
- AWS cloud infrastructure
- Authentication/authorization patterns
- Data privacy considerations
- CI/CD pipeline

### `sample_audit_report.md`
The automated audit output generated by running the sample design through the Solution Auditor.

**What the Audit Checks:**
- ✅ Compliance with architecture standards and ADRs
- ⚠️ Partial compliance where improvements are needed
- ❌ Non-compliance violations that must be fixed

**Key Findings in This Sample:**
- **Data Storage**: Non-compliant - Database not in Hong Kong region (violates ADR-007 on data residency)
- **Authentication**: Partial - Should use Amazon Cognito per ADR-008 instead of JWT/OAuth
- **Regional Compliance**: Non-compliant - All services must be in `ap-east-1` region
- **Monitoring**: Compliant - CloudWatch usage meets standards
- **CI/CD**: Partial - Should use AWS CodePipeline instead of GitHub Actions

## How to Generate Your Own

1. Create a design document (Markdown format works best)
2. Run the auditor:
   ```python
   from reviewer import run_audit
   
   design = open('your_design.md').read()
   audit_report = run_audit(design)
   print(audit_report)
   ```
3. Or use the Streamlit UI's Solution Auditor tab

## What This Demonstrates

This sample shows the "Product" - what you get when you use the Architecture AI Suite:

1. **Automated Compliance Checking** - Catches violations automatically
2. **Standards Enforcement** - References specific ADRs that are violated
3. **Actionable Feedback** - Clear required actions, not just "this is wrong"
4. **Hybrid Analysis** - Checks both configured aspects + auto-discovered requirements from your standards docs

## Real-World Usage

In production, teams would:
1. Write their design in Confluence or as a Markdown doc
2. Submit for audit via the UI or CI/CD pipeline
3. Fix the non-compliant items
4. Re-submit until ✅ all compliant
5. Proceed to implementation with confidence

This prevents architecture drift and ensures new systems follow organizational standards from day one.
